<div style="display: inline-block; height:300px; width:60%;">
<p style="font-size:20px;">He was always my pillar when I knew I'd fall
Always my anchor, so strong and tall
His hard face changes only for me
His softer side, so careless and free
He knows my dreams are too big for this place
His little girl's leaving, ready to begin her race
He knows I'll be thinking of him wherever I go
I know I'm ready to do this on my own
But still I cry and he holds me tight
He tries to be strong, not a tear in sight
I'm ready to reach for the stars in the sky
He's ready to watch his princess fly
It's time to let go, sure of a path to take
But now I know, even pillars can break
For when I drive away, trying to stifle my cries
All I could see were tears in my father's eyes
